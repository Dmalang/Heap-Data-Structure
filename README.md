# Why I Made This Application and How does it contribute to you and to your community

- I made this app to practice using heap structures and learn how they can be applied in real-world situations. A task manager is something many people can relate to and find useful. It helps me stay organized, and it could help others in the community keep track of their responsibilities in a simple way.
